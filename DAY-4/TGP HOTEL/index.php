				<p>Customer Service</p>
                                <p>Excellent service is one of the hospitality industry's primary objectives. Hotel visitors rely on hospitality staff for many of their travel needs.</p>
                                <p>Product Quality</p>
                                <p>Customers love good service, but the hospitality industry must also provide quality products to satisfy customers. Goals based on this important objective vary from restaurant to restaurant and from hotel to hotel. Patrons of a restaurant demand fresh, delicious food</p>
                                <p>Volume</p>
                                <p>Another primary objective of the hospitality industry is customer volume. A restaurant owner wants to see 100 percent of her tables filled during any given service period.</p>
